That was a short presentation of my game, but let's talk about me and why do I code:)

I tried a little bit of programming in high school and I enjoyed it. I had to focus on my Matura exam, so I quit. After that, when we had to choose field of study, I decided that I want to become a developer, so I chose AGH - University of Science and Technology to fully focus on IT area.
Thinking about solusions is addictive for me, and finishing the code makes me super satified. Working in diffirent branches doesn't allow me to fully focus on coding. That's why I want to finally find a job in IT industry and become the best developer in the world (just kidding :D, but I want to be a good developer in the future).
